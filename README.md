##### Greater Arthian Empire
**Greater Arthia** is a large empire covering most of the Eastern and Western continents of **Easorhn**. 

**Arthia** is the capitol city of **Greater Arthia** and the seat of power for the government. It is centrally located on the western continent to ensure that edicts from the crown reach every corner of **Greater Arthia** at around the same time. The original kingdom of **Arthia** was the area around the city which has fallen into disuse over the centuries. 

The central channel bisecting the empire is known simply as **the Bore**. Due to this geopgraphy, **Greater Arthia** has a thriving marine economy.
A large frontier extends to the East from the settled realms of **Greater Arthia**; **Kargonia** is located centrally in this frontier zone.

There are three metropli other than the capitol in the empire, **Kargonia** in the northeast frontier, (a yet to be named and located city), and the **Nyissan** port of **Ischia** to the west across **the Bore**. There is a large frontier city, though not quite a metropolis, named **Manteflaro** located on the southeastern shore at the mouth of the river **Nespo**.

##### The Tsardom of Mevozy
Another kingdom of note with it's own ongoing Campaign is the **Tsardom of Mevozy**. It is predominately good-aligned and of Slavic origins. (I'll let the GMs of that campaign add comments here once they notice this addition)

###### TODO
TODO: Add a blurb for each kingdom (with anchor links in the list at the top of the document) on this world to this document so it isn't Arthia-centric.  

TODO: Rename this repository to Easorhn-Map to further remove that Arthia-cetrism.  

~~TODO: Change `master` branch to `main` branch so I'm not fat fingering my repos and they all match the same layout.~~
